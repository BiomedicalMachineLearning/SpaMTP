\title{Generate new MALDI counts matrix for equivalent Visium spots
\itemize{
\item This function takes an original Spatial Metabolomics counts matrix, along with a metadata table (\code{obs_x}) containing information about the correspondence between MALDI and Visium spots. It generates a new counts matrix where each MALDI spot has an associated aggregated count based on its corresponding Visium spots.
}}
\usage{
generate_new_MALDI_counts(original_MALDI, obs_x, assay)
}
\arguments{
\item{original_MALDI}{A Seurat Spatial Metabolomics object containing the original counts matrix}

\item{obs_x}{A metadata table with information about the correspondence between MALDI and Visium spots. It should have columns 'Visium_spot' and 'MALDI_barcodes'.}

\item{assay}{Character string defining the Seurat assay that contains the annotated counts and metadata corresponding to the m/z values.}
}
\value{
A data frame representing the new counts matrix for equivalent Visium spots,where each row corresponds to a Visium spot and columns correspond to m/z features.
}
