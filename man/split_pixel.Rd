\title{Splits a pixel into multiple spots
- This function takes a central point and a pixel radius and splits the pixel into multiple smaller spots based on the specified configuration.}
\usage{
split_pixel(
  center_point,
  pixel_radius,
  pseudo_n = 4,
  pixel_shape = "square",
  show_split_diagram = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{center_point}{A numeric vector of length 2 representing the (x, y) coordinates of the center point of the pixel.}

\item{pixel_radius}{The radius of the original pixel.}

\item{pseudo_n}{The number of smaller spots to split the pixel into. Must be either 4 or 9 for square pixels and 4 for a circular pixel.}

\item{pixel_shape}{A character string indicating the shape of the original pixel. Options are "square" (default) or "circle".}

\item{show_split_diagram}{A logical indicating whether to plot a diagram showing the original pixel and the split spots (default = FALSE).}
}
\value{
A matrix with two columns representing the (x, y) coordinates of the centers of the smaller spots after splitting the pixel.
}

\examples{
# Split a square pixel into 4 spots
split_pixel(center_point = c(0, 0), pixel_radius = 1, pseudo_n = 4, pixel_shape = "circle", show_split_diagram = TRUE)

# Split a circular pixel into 9 spots and display the split diagram
split_pixel(center_point = c(0, 0), pixel_radius = 1, pseudo_n = 9, pixel_shape = "square", show_split_diagram = TRUE)

# Split a square pixel into 16 spots and display the split diagram
split_pixel(center_point = c(0, 0), pixel_radius = 1, pseudo_n = 16, pixel_shape = "square", show_split_diagram = TRUE)
