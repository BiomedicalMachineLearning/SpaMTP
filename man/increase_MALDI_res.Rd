\title{Increase the resolution of Spatial Metabolomics data for merging with Spatial Transcriptomic (Visium) data
\itemize{
\item This function takes a Spatial Metabolomics dataset and increases its resolution by generating pseudo-high-resolution spots. This is useful for merging the data with Spatial Transcriptomic (Visium) data that has a different resolution.
\item This function uses the split_pixel() function
}}
\usage{
increase_MALDI_res(SM.data, res_increase = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{SM.data}{A Seurat Spatial Metabolomics object containing spatial metabolomic information. It should have 'x_coord' and 'y_coord' columns representing spot coordinates.}

\item{res_increase}{An integer specifying the factor by which the resolution should be increased. res_increase = 4, will generates 4 times as many spots in each dimension (default = 4).}
}
\value{
A data frame with increased resolution metadata, containing additional columns 'new_x_coord', 'new_y_coord', 'new_barcode', and 'old_barcode'. The 'new_x_coord' and 'new_y_coord' columns represent the coordinates of the pseudo-high-resolution spots. The 'new_barcode' column is a unique identifier for each pseudo-high-resolution spot, and 'old_barcode' retains the original spot identifier.
