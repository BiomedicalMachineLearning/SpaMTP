\item{Analyte}{A list of analytes with 3 elements, namely "mz", "genes" and "metabolites", each is comprised of the corresponding labels, for metabolites,
Supported metabolites format including, X stands for upper case of the cooresponding ID in each database: "hmdb:HMDBX", "chebi:X", "pubchem:X","wikidata:X" ,"kegg:X" ,"CAS:X","lipidbank:X","chemspider:X","    LIPIDMAPS:X"
Supported gene data format including: "entrez:X", "gene_symbol:X", "uniprot:X", "ensembl:X", "hmdb:HMDBPX"
Supported mz format: any string or numeric vector contains the m/z}

\item{analyte_type}{= "metabolites" or "gene" or "mz", or a vector contains any combinations of them}

\item{polarity}{The polarity of the MALDI test}

\item{max_path_size}{The max number of metabolites in a specific pathway}

\item{alternative}{The hypothesis of the fisher exact test}

\item{min_path_size}{The min number of metabolites in a specific pathway}
